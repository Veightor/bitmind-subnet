## Identifying AI-Generated Media with a Decentralized Framework

**Overview:**
The BitMind Subnet leverages advanced generative and discriminative AI models within the Bittensor network to detect AI-generated images. This platform is engineered on a decentralized, incentive-driven framework to enhance trustworthiness and stimulate continuous technological advancement.

**Purpose:**
The proliferation of generative AI models has significantly increased the production of high-quality synthetic media, presenting challenges in distinguishing these from authentic content. The BitMind Subnet addresses this challenge by providing robust detection mechanisms to maintain the integrity of digital media.

**Features:**

- **API and Frontend (Coming Soon):** Accessibility will be broadened through an intuitive API and user interface, facilitating the integration and utilization of our detection technologies.
- **Model Evolution:** Our platform continuously integrates the latest research and developments in AI to adapt to evolving generative techniques.

**Core Components:**

- **Miners:** Tasked with running binary classifiers that discern between genuine and AI-generated content.
  - **Foundation Model:** Based on the insights from the 2024 CVPR paper [_Rethinking the Up-Sampling Operations in CNN-based Generative Network for Generalizable Deepfake Detection_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10461), our primary model utilizes Neighborhood Pixel Relationships to detect specific discrepancies in AI-generated images.
  - **Research Integration:** We systematically update our detection models and methodologies in response to emerging academic research, offering resources like training codes and model weights to our community.
- **Validators:** Responsible for challenging miners with a balanced mix of real and synthetic images, drawn from a diverse pool of sources.
  - **Resource Expansion:** We are committed to enhancing the validators' capabilities by increasing the diversity and volume of the image pool, which supports rigorous testing and validation processes.
